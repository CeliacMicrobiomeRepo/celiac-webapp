**About** 

This is the R Shiny web application used to explore The Celiac Gut Microbiome Repository (CMR). The CMR is a comprehensive collection of all available gut microbiome sequencing datasets that include individuals with celiac disease, enabling a best attempt to identify global microbial trends across diverse populations and methodologies. The repository itself exists as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CeliacMicrobiomeRepo/celiac-repository) which contains the associated scripts, data, and documentation to facilitate future work in the field.

The current version is 1.0 which is up to date as of the 10th September 2024 with plans for an update soon.

The code for this site is on its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CeliacMicrobiomeRepo/celiac-webapp).
