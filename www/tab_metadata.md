## Samples Metadata Dictionary
Contains metadata for every sample included in CMR v{{VERSION}}. The file contains the following columns:
  - `Sample_ID`: Unique identifier assigned to each sample within the CMR.
  - `Dataset_ID`: Unique identifier for the dataset the sample belongs to.
  - `Subject_ID`: Repository-assigned identifier for the participant represented by the sample. Repeated samples from the same participant share one identifier. `NA` when the source data do not allow for reliable sample-to-participant linkage.
  - `Sampling_Timepoint`: Study-specific sampling timepoint, such as baseline or a stated follow-up interval. `single` denotes a cross-sectional study or one sampling occasion. `NA` is used when a timepoint cannot be determined reliably. The anchor differs between studies. For most datasets the labels count time since baseline or since the start of an intervention, while for the infant cohorts they denote the participant's age at collection.
  - `SRA_Run_ID`: Sequence Read Archive (SRA) run accession number for the sample. 'NA' if not on SRA.
  - `SRA_Project_ID`: SRA BioProject accession number for the study. 'NA' if not on SRA.

'False' includes participants enrolled under an exclusion criterion that rules out antibiotic use within the study's stated window. 'NA' where the study did not collect it or the participant did not answer.
  - `Delivery_Mode`: Mode of delivery at birth ('vaginal', 'cesarean'). 'NA' where not reported. Recorded for the infant and prospective birth-cohort datasets.
  - `Age_At_CD_Diagnosis_Years`: Age in years at celiac disease diagnosis, for participants who were diagnosed.
